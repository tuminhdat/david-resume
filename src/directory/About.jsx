        Hello to those viewing my pages,
        <br /><br /> 
        Hello, my name is David Tu and I am a motivated and enthusiastic individual with a passion for Computer programming. 
        I recently graduated from Simon Fraser University with a degree in Computer Science and 
        I am eager to put my education and skills to use in a challenging and rewarding role.
        <br /><br />
        I have a strong understanding of various technologies and programming languages, including web development, data structures and algorithms, databases(T-SQL), and object-oriented programming (OOP) languages.
        I'm constantly learning and staying up to date with the latest developments in my field.  
        <br /><br /> 
        I am confident in my ability to succeed in Computer programming and I am eager to continue growing and developing my skills. 
        I am a quick learner and I am always willing to go the extra mile to ensure that projects are completed to the highest standard.
        <br /><br />
        I am excited about the prospect of starting my career and I believe that Computer programming is the perfect place for me to do so. 
        I am eager to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to a company that values hard work, creativity, and innovation. 
        <br /><br />
